\section{NIC Activities}
%ssc I changed the title of this section, but I'm not sure how to Latex it so that it updates in the full draft. Sorry!
The NMIX+CS project will use a NIC model for developing and coordinating activities across and between the project partners. As described above, project partners have a long history of successful collaboration as well as current collaborations through projects like NM CS4All and the NM SMART Grid Center. 

\textbf{Shared Goal:} Project partners have the shared goal of developing an integrated state-wide framework for CS+X education programs. Elements to support that goal include:
\begin{itemize}
        \item 
        \item Commitments from provosts at each institution to investigate formalizing collaboration through mechanisms like cross-institution course sharing
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Theory of Improvement}

\textbf{Common Metrics:} Along with the coordinated effort in developing a theory of improvement for X+CS curricula, the NIC will employ shared employ shared metrics through a coordinated assessment and evaluation plan  developed by a dedicated internal evaluator and implemented across the entire NIC.

\textbf{Network Management}
The interaction between the members of the NIC will  rely on frequent communications. Individual subteams (e.g., working on specific course modules) will rely on frequent virtual meetings (e.g., based on Zoom). Face-to-Face meetings for the entire team will occur with a frequency of at least one time per semester, relying on excellent meeting facilities available to the NIC members (e.g., the UNM Sevilleta Field Station, the New Mexico Consortium).
