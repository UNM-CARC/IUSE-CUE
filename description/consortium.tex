NMSU is a Carnegie Doctoral University Higher Research Activity institution, with over \$100M in research expenditures, and it is a Carnegie Community Engagement University. NMSU offers 93 bachelor's degree programs, 56 master's degree programs and 27 doctoral programs. NMSU is ranked among top colleges by Forbes and US News \& World Report. CollegeNET places NMSU among the top 12\% for improving students’ social mobility. The Diverse: Issues in Higher Education places NMSU

In Fall 2018, NMSU had 14,289 students enrolled, of which 55.6\% were female, 56\% were Hispanic, 2.1\%
Native Americans, and 2.6\% African American. About 40\% of the students were Pell grant eligible.
