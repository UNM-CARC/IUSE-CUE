\section{Implementation Plan}
Organizing the participating institutions as a NIC will allow us to rapidly pilot a number of innovations, assess the results, and refine our interventions within a cross-institutional and cross-disciplinary framework. The proposed activities will take place over an 18-month period and will lay the groundwork for more formalized structures, like degree pathways, minors and certificates within individual institutions, as well as course- and curricula-sharing agreements between institutions. Our implementation plan has two interweaving strands---educational development and NIC management---described below.

\subsection{Educational Development}
\begin{description}
\setlength\itemsep{0in}
    \item[Spring 2020:] Module development/deployment/assessment for discipline intro classes; Six 1-week course modules
    \item[Summer 2020:] Evaluate/assess spring results, develop fall discipline/general courses, including: discipline assignments for core CS classes, sophomore-level data science class with discipline-specific project/modules, and student peer mentor training
    \item[Fall 2020:] Train mentors at start of semester; Continue development of data science classes; Offer core class to discipline participants; Mentoring activities and assessment in the core class
    \item[Spring 2021:] Offer and assess data science class.
    \item[Summer 2021:] Specialized data science class to specific disciplines as determined. Start to develop projects for use in capstone classes
\end{description}

\subsection{NIC Management}

\begin{description}
\setlength\itemsep{0in}
    \item[Spring 2020:] Kickoff meeting at Sevilleta - finalize metrics, assessment, initial planning/coordination of module development, etc. Bi-weekly cross-disciplinary working meetings within institutions. Monthly zoom meetings for management team. Slack channel for informal NIC communications.
    \item[Summer 2020:] Regular project meeting + advisory board meeting; Align CS core classes at institutions; Initial cross-institution course sharing discussions; Recruit student peer mentors
    \item[Fall 2020:] Regular project meeting (discussions of assessment/metrics, etc.). Late fall programmatic assessment meeting
    \item[Spring 2021:] Regular project meeting + advisory board meeting. Mentor/trainee meetings.
    \item[Summer 2021:] Wrap Up meeting for all. Programmatic assessment meeting
\end{description}
