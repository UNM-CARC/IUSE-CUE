\paragraph{Intellectual Merit:} Our proposed research encompasses four key contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item First, we will...
\item Second, we will...
\item Third, we will...
\item Fourth, we will...
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Broader Impact:} The proposed research will have significant impact
both in the broader high performance computing community as well as directly
in educational activities. First, the techniques we propose will...

In addition, we will also integrate the developed techniques into the UNM
Computer Science and Library Sciences curricula and recruit to increase the 
participation of women and under-represented minorities in research. This work includes...

Finally, will also explicitly work to broaden the participation of women and under-represented
minorities in computer and library sciences as part of this project. Two
graduate students will be recruited and trained by the PIs to be actively engaged
in project research, and every effort will be made to recruit the students
from the pool of women and under-represented minorities. This effort  will
leverage both UNM's position as one of two Hispanic serving institutions that are also designated
to have ``very high research activity'' according to the Carnegie Classification, and 
existing Diversity Programs in the UNM School of Engineering.
