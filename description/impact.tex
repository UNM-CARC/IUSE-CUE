\section{Broadening Participation in Computing}

Research supported by the project will also broaden the participation of women and under-represented
minorities in computer science and electrical and computer engineering
as part of this project. The PIs are strongly committed to broadening the
participation of minority and under-represented groups in their research. 
For example, ...

UNM is one of two Hispanic serving institutions that are also designated
to have ``very high research activity''
according to the Carnegie Classification, and we will leverage the Diversity
Programs in the School of Engineering and several key regional student
recruitment opportunities; for example, the PIs research will engage with the New Mexico
Supercomputing Challenge~\cite{NMChallenge}, a 25 year-old program that
engages New Mexico high school students (33\% young women, 40\% underrepresented)
to compete with computing projects.  10,500 students have participated from across the state. The
PIs have close ties with this initiative, CARC hosts Challenge evaluations and projects,
and project PIs have participated as judges and volunteers to increase departmental diversity.
