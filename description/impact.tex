Computer Science is one of the least diverse majors with 19\% women and 19\% URMs earning CS bachelor's degrees nationally. NMIX+CS is poised to dramatically increase the diversity of students with CS training by 1) leveraging our highly diverse student populations and 2) taking computing into other disciplines that have more diverse student populations. For example, Nursing is primarily women~\cite{nursing} and Biomedical Engineering  is among the top 5 majors among Hispanic students~\cite{biomed}. By offering X+CS courses, we will dramatically expand the number and diversity of students in CS courses at our institutions. This effort builds on our successful track record in this area in programs such as NM CSforAll (over 1500 students in 5 years, 75\% from underrepresented groups) and CS 0,
and we further integrate CS into disciplines that both need CS skills and have large numbers of students underrepresented in traditional CS majors. 
%NMT has engaged in a number of activities to promote CS education within the institution as well as across the state, e.g., the \textit{Introduction to Programming with Python} course designed for non-CS majors, and a set of CS courses such as \textit{Survey of Computer Science} and \textit{Cryptography and Computer Security} for Master of Science Teaching students.

In addition to leveraging the success of our existing programs and expanding computing into non-CS courses, NMIX+CS will employ evidence-based best practices developed by the Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (CAHSI), of which NMSU is a charter member. We will incorporate CAHSI innovations described above in Student Support Activities. CAHSI INCLUDES leadership has committed to collaborating on this project and will provide expertise as well as opportunities to disseminate NMIX+CS findings and best practices.
