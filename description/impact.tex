CAHSI provides evidence-based practices that are focused on promoting success of Hispanic students in computing. As part of the mentoring process we could introduce some of these practices in the deployment of new curricular. One idea could be to introduce Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) in the new courses and perhaps use the peer leaders across the different institutions (e.g., using collaborative virtual environments) or in the least share the training of peer leaders across the institutions. 

CAHSI can also be used as a dissemination instrument---once we have a good model for NIC and CS+X in HSIs, we could hold workshops within the different CAHSI INCLUDES regions and in turn present the model at the CAHSI Symposium (associated to HENAAC).
