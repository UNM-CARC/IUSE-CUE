\paragraph{Melanie Moses:}
\textbf{NSF Grant 1240992, Supplement PI Moses, original PI Lee, ``CS 10K: New Mexico Computer Science for All (NM CSforAll)'', November 2012--October 2017, \$1,226,332} 

\noindent \textit{Intellectual Merit:} The NM CSforAll program is a teacher PD and AP CS Principles-aligned high school course that teaches computer modeling and simulation, computational thinking, programming and pedagogy. %It addresses the lack of CS-trained teachers and formal CS courses in NM high schools. Online teacher PD, the high school course, and a freshman non-majors course have been taught in a hybrid flipped-classroom with videos, example code, programming assignments, tests, grading rubrics and extensive curricular material hosted online. Teachers guide their students in programming labs during class time. 
%The curriculum aligns with the CS Principles Big Ideas and Learning Objectives (particularly focused on Impact, Abstraction, Algorithms, Programming, and Data) and the CSTA K-12 Standards \textcolor{red}{REF Lee et al}.
The project demonstrated that computational modeling is an effective way to teach CS content and skills while fostering positive attitudes and student engagement.
%Additionally, a hybrid flipped-classroom course that offers college dual credit can be scaled up to teach CS to a rural, socio-economically disadvantaged and underrepresented population.  
Teachers and students showed significant increases in learning objectives; 100\% of teachers rated the PD very good or excellent. Increasing creative and open-ended design modules is particularly effective for Native and Hispanic students who were found to be significantly more likely than their peers to find CS important for scientific problem solving and a necessary skill for everyone to learn.
%\textcolor{red}{REF Svihla}. Students also made significant improvements on math objectives \textcolor{red}{REF math conf paper}. This work was chosen as a SIGCSE 2017 exemplary paper (top 7.5\% of submissions). \textcolor{red}{REF Lee et al.}

\noindent \textit{Broader Impact:}
51 high school teachers from 18 NM school districts completed NM CSforAll PD and taught over 1300 students; 75\% are underrepresented including 36\% women and 20\% Native American. An undergraduate section of the course at UNM that switched recruitment from pre-computer science majors to advertising the course as satisfying the natural science core, enrollment rose from 14 to 42\% women. 
%Through a partnership of CS educators, NM CSforAll contributed to a 2017 New Mexico law that allows CS to count toward NM high school math or science graduation requirements. 
%The Swarmathon Project Module, initially developed by NM CSforAll REUs, was used by over 450 high school students in 23 high schools across the US to compete in the 2017 virtual NetLogo NASA Swarmathon Challenge. 
%NM CSforAll course content is freely distributed (http://cs4all.cs.unm.edu/).
